# Principles Check

Evaluate any effort, idea, or time allocation against guiding principles.

## When to Use

- **Before starting**: Should I spend time on this?
- **After completing**: Was this a good use of time?
- **Ideating**: Which of these ideas best fits the principles?
- **Feeling scattered**: What should actually get attention?
- **Reviewing output**: Did this week align with what matters?

## The Principles

Source: `resources/guiding-principles.md`

If no principles file exists, offer to help the user define some. Common principle categories:

### Mindset
- Building things that compound vs one-offs
- Skills vs money focus
- Long-term vs reactive thinking

### Building
- Protecting time/constraints
- Rhythm vs sprints
- Breadth vs depth at different stages

### Foundation
- Health as multiplier
- Presence and relationships
- What enables everything else

## Execution

### For a Specific Effort/Idea

Read the principles file, then evaluate against each:

```markdown
## Principles Check: [Effort Name]

| Principle | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| [Principle 1] | Strong/Moderate/Weak/Neutral | Why |
| [Principle 2] | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Overall Alignment**: Strong / Moderate / Weak / Misaligned

**Verdict**: [Pursue / Defer / Decline / Reconsider approach]

**Key Insight**: [One sentence on what this evaluation reveals]
```

Scoring:
- **Strong**: Directly advances this principle
- **Moderate**: Somewhat aligned, indirect benefit
- **Weak**: Minimal connection
- **Neutral**: Not relevant to this principle
- **Negative**: Works against this principle

### For Comparing Options

When deciding between multiple ideas/efforts:

```markdown
## Principles Check: Comparing Options

| Principle | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Principle 1] | Strong | Weak | Moderate |
| [Principle 2] | Moderate | Strong | Weak |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Recommendation**: Option [X] because [reasoning]

**Trade-off acknowledged**: [What you're giving up]
```

### For Time Allocation Review

When reviewing a period (week/month):

```markdown
## Principles Alignment: [Period]

### Where Time Went
[Summary of major efforts]

### Principle Coverage

| Principle | How It Showed Up | Gap? |
|-----------|-----------------|------|
| [Principle 1] | Built X, published Y | No |
| [Principle 2] | Learned Z | No |
| [Principle 3] | ... | Yes - reactive mode |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Principles Neglected
- [Principle]: [How it was neglected]

### Adjustment for Next Period
- [Specific action to better align]
```

## Interpretation Notes

Not every effort needs to score high on all principles. The framework helps make trade-offs explicit:

- **A quick task** might score low on "compound" but high on "protect the constraint" (clearing the decks)
- **Deep work** might score low on "present when present" but high on "skills lead"
- **Family time** scores high on "present" and "relationships" but may be neutral on "compound"

The goal isn't perfect scores. It's conscious allocation.

## Integration

- **Weekly review**: Include principles alignment check
- **Before major commitments**: Run principles check
- **When feeling scattered**: Use to clarify priorities
- **Ideation sessions**: Filter ideas through principles

## Red Flags

Watch for patterns:
- Consistently weak on "protect the constraint" = overcommitment
- Neglecting "health" or "present" = foundation erosion
- All "validate wide", never "master deep" = perpetual exploration
- Chasing outcomes without building skills = short-term trap
