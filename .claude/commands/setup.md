description: Run customisation wizard to configure Arc for yourself
---

Customise Arc for your personal use.

Use the **setup** skill (`.claude/skills/setup/SKILL.md`) to:

1. Ask about your context (name, work, projects, life areas)
2. Ask about communication preferences
3. Ask about privacy/sensitive terms
4. Generate personalised configuration files:
   - `.claude/rules/personal/user-context.md`
   - `state/focus.md`
   - `state/projects.json`
   - `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-privacy.sh`

Run this on first use, or anytime you want to update your configuration.
