# No Emojis

Do not use emojis in any output unless the user explicitly requests them.

This applies to:
- Conversation responses
- File content (markdown, notes, sessions)
- Commit messages
- Any generated text

Exceptions:
- User asks for them
- Quoting external content that contains them
- Technical contexts where emoji are meaningful (e.g., GitHub reactions in documentation)
